Wira Ranking Dashboard

This project is a web application built using Vue.js, allowing players to view their own rankings or the rankings of other players. The website also showcases the pictures of the top 3 players in the game. Additionally, the app includes a search function that enables players to find others simply by using their username, although this feature is not yet fully functional.

The website provides "Previous" and "Next" buttons, allowing users to navigate through the player rankings, which are arranged in order of scores, with the highest score at the top. Players can easily browse the rankings by using these buttons.

To enhance the user experience, the application includes a background song that plays while users browse the website, creating a more immersive atmosphere. Furthermore, the website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
