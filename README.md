Wira Ranking Dashboard

This project is a web application built using Vue.js, allowing players to view their own rankings or
the rankings of other players. The website also showcases the pictures of the top 3 players in
the game. Additionally, the app includes a search function that enables players to find others
simply by using their username.

The website provides "Previous" and "Next" buttons, allowing users to navigate through the
player rankings, which are arranged in order of scores, with the highest score at the top. Players
can easily browse the rankings by using these buttons.


Furthermore, the website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both
desktop and mobile devices.
